# mct's junkdrawer or junkcode

A dumping ground for random code snippets and tiny tools I've written or
accumulated over the years.  They are generally either too small, too silly, or
with no accompanying documentation to warrant them being released on their own.
Inspired by [Tridge's junk code](https://www.samba.org/junkcode/).  I'm putting
them here either because I think they may be useful to someone, or I've had
occasion to point someone to one of them as an example, or I refer to code in
here myself as examples.

## License

For things I've written, either Public Domain, or any BSD license you choose.
