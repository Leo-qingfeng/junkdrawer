# mct's junkdrawer of junkcode

A dumping ground for random code snippets, tiny tools, and test programs I've
written, or accumulated over the years.  They're generally either too small,
too silly, too undocumented, or too specific to warrant being released on their
own.  Inspired by [Tridge's junk code](https://www.samba.org/junkcode/).  I'm
putting them here because they may be useful to someone, or I've had occasion
to reference them in discussion with someone, or to refer to them myself as
templates or examples.
